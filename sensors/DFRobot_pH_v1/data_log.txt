###=============###
### DESCRIPTION ###
###=============###

Calibration and testing of DFRobot (SEN0161) and Hanna Instruments (HI1286) 
analog pH sensors with a DFRobot pH meter v1.1 (SEN0161) over a month.



###===========###
###  RESULTS  ### 
###===========###

Both sensors work well with a small drift and stable voltage 
output over weeks (if the room temperature is stable). 



###=========###
###  NOTES  ###
###=========###

Temperature compensation is not implemented in the DFRobot meter v.1.
Room temperature slightly affects pH: more t lower pH.
